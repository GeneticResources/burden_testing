## This file contains coordinates of the gene related genomic features and annotation:
geneBedFile=/lustre/scratch113/projects/helic/ds26/project_burden/2016.10.10/Linked_features.bed.gz

## 15x vcf files and dir, it has to be updated if a new release was generated:
vcfFile=/lustre/scratch115/projects/t144_helic_15x/analysis/HA/release/postrelease_missingnessfilter/%s.missingfiltered-0.01_consequences.lof.vcf.gz
vcfDir=/lustre/scratch115/realdata/mdt0/projects/t144_helic_15x/analysis/HA/release/postrelease_missingnessfilter/

## To get CADD/Eigen/GERP scores, we have to lift over the coordinates. Path to liftover:
liftoverPath=/nfs/users/nfs_d/ds26/bin/liftOver

## This is where the temporary bedfile will be generated:
temporaryBedFile=./%s_GRCh38.bed

## Path to Eigen scores (in this release coding and non-coding variants are located in separate files):
EigenPath=/lustre/scratch115/projects/t144_helic_15x/analysis/HA/weights/eigen.phred_v2.dat

## Path to CADD scores:
caddPath=/lustre/scratch114/resources/cadd_scores/20150729-v1.3/whole_genome_SNVs_inclAnno.tsv.gz

## Path to workig installation of GWAVA:
GWAVA_DIR=/lustre/scratch113/teams/zeggini/users/ds26/GWAVA/gwava_release

## Path to bigWigTools to extract linsight scores:
bigWigTools=/nfs/team144/software/bigWigTools

## Path to linsight file:
Linsight=/lustre/scratch115/projects/t144_helic_15x/analysis/HA/weights/LINSIGHT/LINSIGHT.bw

## From where the script read the single point associations:
singlePointDir=/lustre/scratch115/projects/t144_helic_15x/analysis/HA/single_point/output/missing_chunks/

## genome-wide plink files:
plinkFile=/lustre/scratch115/projects/t144_helic_15x/analysis/HA/single_point/input/whole_genome/autosomal

## Path to MONSTER executable:
MONSTER=/nfs/team144/software/MONSTER_v1.3/MONSTER

# Distance around the gene we fetch variants with phenotypes:
export window=500000

# Folder with all the phenotypes:
export phenotypeDir=/lustre/scratch115/projects/t144_helic_15x/analysis/HA/phenotypes/correct_names.andmissing

# Kinship matrix file:
export kinshipMatrix=/nfs/team144/ds26/burden_testing/kinship/2016.10.20_fix_diagonal/kinship.fixdiag.txt

# By default we are not keeping temporary files:
keep_temp=0

# By default the hit threshold is 1e-5
export signifThreshold=1e-5

# A function to get the vcf file name based on the chromosome name and the path:

}

# A function to get the single point file name based on the phenotype name and the path:
function get_singlePoint_filename(){

    fi

}

# A function to get the vcf file name based on the chromosome name and the path:
function get_phenotype_filename(){
    if [[ ! -z "$1" ]]; then  
        echo ${phenotypeDir}/MANOLIS.${1}.txt
