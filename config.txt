## This file contains coordinates of the gene related genomic features and annotation:
Linked_features=/lustre/scratch113/projects/helic/ds26/project_burden/2016.10.10/Linked_features.bed.gz

## To get CADD/Eigen/GERP scores, we have to lift over the coordinates. Path to liftover:
liftoverPath=/nfs/users/nfs_d/ds26/bin/liftOver

## Path to Eigen scores (in this release coding and non-coding variants are located in separate files):
EigenPath=/lustre/scratch115/projects/t144_helic_15x/analysis/HA/weights/eigen.phred_v2.dat

## Path to CADD scores:
caddPath=/lustre/scratch114/resources/cadd_scores/20150729-v1.3/whole_genome_SNVs_inclAnno.tsv.gz

## Path to bigWigTools to extract linsight scores:
bigWigTools=/nfs/team144/software/bigWigTools

## Path to linsight file:
Linsight=/lustre/scratch115/projects/t144_helic_15x/analysis/HA/weights/LINSIGHT/LINSIGHT.bw
